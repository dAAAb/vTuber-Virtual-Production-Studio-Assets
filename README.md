# vTuber-Virtual-Production-Studio-Assets

vTuber Studio Pro Asset Pack

Summery
This is an asset pack for doing virtual productions. You can apply these assets and workflows to your games, or vr simulations to capture multi-camera realtime footage from within a viedo game running Unity3d. 

Included is a full studio environment setup to make virtual podcast, and video content from inside Unity3d. There are no avatars included, but this package is a great starting point to create a virtual world to produce content in. 

Please check out the examples and tutorials on my youtube page to get familiar on the workflow on virtual prodcutions. These asseta can be ported to work in any game engine, and the camera control scipts have been written in C#.

There are different versions of this suite. This is the boilerplate version. I have create templated worlds for VRC as well you can obtain. This package would be a good starting point for anyone interested is making virtual productions over the network inside Unity and VRChat. 

Inside Unity, you can create your own set or sound stage and then use this camera system to help you speed up production with access to 9 cameras, and 12 overlay slides.

You can swap out the slides once you have setup a unity project and imported the package. This is used as a real-time production environment from which we capture the output with OBS.

Move the cameras (via the Parent Object) and feel free to animate or extend the cameras to do even more things. I suggest you create a sound stage / set that works for your needs.

Pro-Tip: Because of the way the camera previews work, only move the Master Root of each camera. You can add a Parent object to the cameras, and animate those for animated camera tracks. Also the names of the layers are reset when VRC SDK setups layers for a project, so the Layers that hide things from the camera lose their name (but still work)... if you would like to hide / show things in the camear view, please re-setup layers and use camera culling.

We have filmed many music videos, podcasts and events in VR using this system. It has sped up production when making rooms or builds for vTubing, vPodcasts, and vFilms, and endless "over the network, real-time collaborative" projects.

Please check out some our productions on Youtube "Godfrey Meyer" or #boomboxhead to find videos. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me #boomboxhead on discord painterpainting#5603. Have fun and link me to the videos you make, thanks!
